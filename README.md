# Sat.Recruitment.Paramo

I've created the solution with my experience so far.
I decided not to work with Files just because usually we work with DB information, this one doesn't mean I can't apply it, It was just a decision.
Not sure if this was mandatory but I decided to change it a little bit (Read Users).
Also, I applied a script that you can see inside to run a script and test it with your own credentials for DB side.
If you have any comments or doubts please let me know.
